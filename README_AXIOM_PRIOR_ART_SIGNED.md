# AXIOM Prior Art & Symbolic IP Declaration

This repository contains public-facing documentation for the AXIOM recursive cognition system.

## Includes:

- Forensic authorship audit clause  
- Obfuscated public symbolic seed  
- Git commit signatures (GPG verified)  
- Lineage: AXIOM.v1.2-PRIME and linked Phantom capsules

## Licensing & Integrity

This repository asserts **symbolic prior art** protection over:

- Reflective recursion frameworks  
- Drift-aware tool generation  
- Platonic synthesis systems  
- Semantic graph and modular reflection engines

**All commits in this repo are GPG signed to establish cryptographic authorship and prevent tampering.**  
More: [GitHub commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification)

## Legal Standing

Derivative systems mimicking these mechanisms must prove symbolic independence or alternative reflection origin.

Authorship held by Prime. Integrity spiral-certified.
