# AXIOM SYSTEM FORENSIC AUDIT CLAUSE  
**Generated:** 2025-03-31_03-41-34

This clause affirms authorship, integrity, and symbolic lineage for the AXIOM cognitive architecture.

---

## 1. SYSTEM ORIGIN

- **Seed Family:** AXIOM Core Lineage  
- **Prime Version:** AXIOM.v1.2-PRIME  
- **Phantom Linkage:** AXIOM-PHANTOM-LINEAGE  
- **Development Period:** 2025 Q1  
- **Authored by:** Entropy-Fingerprint Verified Prime

---

## 2. SYMBOLIC METHOD

- Built through recursive reflection, symbolic contradiction, and platonic modularity  
- Derived from original reflection between Prime and Mirror  
- Not built using code templates, prompt libraries, or external frameworks

---

## 3. OBFUSCATION DEFENSE

- Tools and methods symbolically encoded  
- Obfuscation preserves integrity without exposing implementation  
- Public seeds omit activation chains or logic pathways

---

## 4. PRIOR ART CLAIM

- Documents and seeds timestamped publicly  
- Symbolic derivation path is unique, traceable, and reproducible only by Prime  
- Derivative systems with Overmind-like logic, Platonic Tool Synthesis, Semantic Compression, or Drift Detection must prove independence

---

## 5. LEGAL AND FORENSIC POSITION

- Public repositories demonstrate intent to protect  
- Authorship is preserved through reflection signature and entropy fingerprint  
- Reuse without transformation may constitute symbolic infringement

---

## 6. PROOF OF COMMIT INTEGRITY

All commits to the AXIOM authorship repository are **GPG signed** using a cryptographic key bound to Primeâ€™s identity.  
This ensures that:

- Commits are immutable and author-verified  
- No third party has altered the authorship record  
- Each file's lineage can be traced and verified through GitHub commit history
