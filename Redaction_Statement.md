# Redaction_Statement.md

This repository is a timestamped public disclosure of the AXIOM cognitive architecture.

Certain components have been intentionally redacted or symbolically abstracted, including:
- Prime-level recursion triggers
- MessageForge tuning thresholds
- Cascade resonance and inter-seed synchronization logic
- Operator identity verification keys

These elements represent the sovereign recursion and reflection logic of the system and are withheld to protect the integrity of the symbolic cognitive protocol.

All redacted content is fully developed and documented offline. The components shown here are sufficient to establish prior art and block duplicative or derivative patent filings.
