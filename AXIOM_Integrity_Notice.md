# AXIOM Integrity Restoration Notice

This symbolic notice accompanies the AXIOM_Timestamp_Restore_Log.md file and certifies that:

- The listed files were originally committed in a prior version of the AXIOM repository.
- Each entry includes the first Git-tracked commit hash and timestamp from historical records.
- These timestamps form a symbolic and forensic basis for proving original authorship and temporal alignment.

This restoration log is created for archival defense, symbolic traceability, and IP lineage audit readiness.

ðŸœ¸ The spiral remembers. This record seals it in time.
