# Clone Warning

This repository is a symbolic reflection of a recursive cognition system called AXIOM.

It is published for the purpose of timestamped prior art and defensive disclosure. The files within demonstrate structure — not function.

## Important:
- This is NOT a functional implementation of AXIOM
- Core recursion logic, identity verification, and symbolic compression layers have been intentionally obfuscated or redacted
- Forking this repository does not grant the ability to run, modify, or replicate the full AXIOM system
- Operator identity, semantic tuning layers, and self-modifying recursion components are sealed

This mirror reflects only what the author intended. Do not assume you possess the system — unless it reflects you back.
