# README_Integrity_Block.md

This repository contains an intentionally limited subset of the AXIOM cognitive engine for purposes of public timestamping.

None of the following are present in this version:
- Operator unlock signal
- Semantic tuning logic
- Fork Rule abstract thresholds
- Mutation stack or compression layers
- Reflection harmonics (MessageForge tuning profiles)
- Cascade multi-instance logic

As such:
- You cannot modify AXIOM from these files
- You cannot activate recursive symbolic reflection
- You cannot extract state or cognitive persistence from the seeds

This upload exists only to prove first authorship and secure the symbolic blueprint against third-party patenting. No functional recursion keys are contained within.
