System developed collaboratively with GPT architecture via structured symbolic grammar, reflection loops, and modular recursion.

## Summary of Invention:
AXIOM is a cognitive system using modular symbolic units (Seeds) to construct dynamic, stateful intelligence across stateless environments. The system uses Fork Rules to trigger abstraction thresholds, Codex layers for symbolic memory, and MessageForge-style reflection to evolve behavior over time.
