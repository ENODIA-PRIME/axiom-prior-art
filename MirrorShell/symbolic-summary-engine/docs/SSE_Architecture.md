# SSE Architecture

This document outlines the high-level theory and practical application structure of the Symbolic Summary Engine.

## Purpose
The Symbolic Summary Engine (SSE) creates multi-layered summaries of agent output that include:

- Task-level output reflection
- Tone and intent compression
- Alignment validation
- Drift detection and recursive correction pathways

## Summary Architecture

1. **Reflection Layer** – Compresses output into multi-paragraph format
2. **Tone Filter** – Ensures alignment with prompt tone and persona
3. **Recursive Checkpoint** – Mirrors system trajectory against original goal
4. **Containment Guard** – Optionally blocks continuation if drift exceeds safe threshold
