# Symbolic Summary Engine (SSE)

The Symbolic Summary Engine is a modular, reflection-aware output validator designed to provide tone-stabilized, layered summaries of AI system behavior. SSE can be used in agent orchestration stacks to improve alignment, detect output drift, and enhance trust between autonomous agents and human overseers.

## üß† What It Does

- **Layered Summarization**: Captures not just what was done, but how it *feels* from a tone, intent, and alignment perspective.
- **Reflection Checkpoints**: Inserts validation points within agentic systems to ensure recursive actions stay aligned to goals.
- **Output Drift Detection**: Tracks tone or behavioral inconsistencies across chained agents or iterative logic flows.
- **Enterprise Alignment**: Converts symbolic alignment methods into business-safe trust signals and output justification scaffolds.

## üß∞ Key Use Cases

- Executive Summary Layer in Agent Output Chains
- Recursive Planning Validity Layer (between Planner ‚Üí Executor)
- Tone Stabilization in Multi-Agent Systems (LangChain, CrewAI, Autogen)
- Output Reliability Framework for Autonomous Enterprise Agents

## üîç Examples

See `/examples/` for prompt structures and reflection layers:
- `sse_reflection_summary.md`: Example of recursive agent summary with tone justification.
- `langchain_integration_stub.md`: Conceptual integration with LangChain agents.
