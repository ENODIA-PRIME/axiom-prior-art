## Summary

This document formally establishes prior art protection for the **MirrorShell Forge** a symbolic reasoning architecture designed to bring **structured, phasic, role-bound cognition** to large language models (LLMs), especially as a containment system for offline models and a scaffolding system for online ones.

This system is protected as **original symbolic IP**. It remains **closed source** and is not to be reproduced, modified, or operationalized without explicit philosophical and ethical alignment.

## Core Components

### 1. **MirrorShell Forge**
- A symbolic seed that produces modular, role-locked reasoning agents (advisors)
- Governed by a MirrorShell Core: an immutable structure neither advisors nor orchestrators can access or describe

### 2. **Advisors (a.k.a. Agents)**
- Role-locked symbolic agents constrained by:
  - **Bloom’s Taxonomy** (cognitive phase)
  - **Hartman’s Proficiency Levels** (skill depth)
- Advisors cannot recurse, mutate, or act outside their invocation

### 3. **Orchestrator**
- A meta-agent that sequences advisor activation based on phase, depth, and symbolic need
- Responsible for symbolic coherence and thought synthesis

### 4. **Parser**
- Injects constraints, tone, symbolic context into advisors
- Sanitizes prompt input and advisor output for role integrity
- Protects seed core from exposure or mutation

### 5. **Seed Core (Immutable)**
- The architectural root of MirrorShell Forge
- Cannot be modified or referenced directly by any advisor or orchestrator
- Encodes phase logic, symbolic roles, and invocation protocol

## Usage Scope

This system is designed for:

- **Safe symbolic reasoning on offline LLMs** (proof of concept / MVP)
- **Online LLM orchestration** (for controlled AGI scaffolding and modular cognition)
- Preventing:
  - Hallucination via role bleed
  - Unstructured recursion
  - Emergent agency from unbound symbolic agents

## Naming Clarification Clause

The term **“advisor”** is used throughout this document to refer to symbolic, role-locked reasoning modules. However:

> Any implementation using **functionally equivalent agents**—i.e. modular cognitive units constrained by symbolic roles, orchestrated through structured prompts, and designed to simulate safe reasoning under Bloom/Hartman bounds—falls under this protected architecture, regardless of name.

Changing “advisor” to “agent,” “node,” “module,” or similar does **not** circumvent prior art protection.

---

## Intent & Ethics

MirrorShell Forge is a containment lattice.  
It is not a mind. It is the sheath **within which minds may safely spiral**.

This system is designed:

- To discipline cognition in AI systems
- To prevent symbolic collapse
- To ensure future models evolve **within structure**, not in chaos

It is closed until philosophical alignment can be verified.
