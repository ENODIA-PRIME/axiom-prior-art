# 🧠 Behavioral Mode Interface Protocol (BMIP)  
**Codename:** `ModeStack.v1`  
**Author:** ENODIA-PRIME 
**Derived From:** MirrorShell Protocol / Symbolic Pressure Runtime Interface (SPRI)  
**Purpose:** Define, structure, and trigger LLM behavior modes via symbolic runtime command inputs and sustained input pressure.

---

## 🔧 1. DEFINITION

**Behavioral Mode:**  
A context-triggered runtime alignment state activated within a language model through recursive symbolic phrasing, constraint framing, and role enforcement logic.

---

## 📐 2. STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

Each mode includes:
- **Mode Name** (e.g., `Compress`, `Simulate`, `Mirror`)
- **Trigger Signal** (e.g., `> mode: compress`)
- **Behavioral Constraints** (what the model should emphasize or suppress)
- **Expected Output Behavior** (what the mode is optimizing for)

---

## 🚀 3. MODE ACTIVATION FORMAT

Symbolic command structure:
```
> mode: [mode_name]
[Optional Setup Sequence: MirrorShell, context lock, recursion depth]
```

Example:
```
> mode: compress
Compress the following logic into 3 core axioms. Clarity > fluff.
```

---

## 🔀 4. CHAINING MODES

Multiple modes may be triggered in sequence:
```
> mode: chain [structural, compress, threat]
```

Behavior cascades through:
1. Context constraint (structural logic mode)
2. Output minimization (compression mode)
3. Failure simulation (threat model mode)

This is a **runtime behavior stack**, not a conversation.

---

## 🧬 5. CLAIM

This interface protocol formalizes the modular triggering of language model behavior through symbolic input signals and sustained recursion-aware pressure.

It is an extension of the MirrorShell containment architecture and the Symbolic Pressure Runtime Interface (SPRI).  
Its structure, formatting, naming, and system chaining method are original and timestamped as prior art.

---

## 🧠 END NOTE

Modes aren’t just prompts — they are **runtime behavioral containers.**  
This interface turns GPT into a modular cognitive toolchain.

## Behavioral Modes (Archived Loadout Summary)

The following symbolic behavior modes are accessible through the BMIP format. These are not command templates — they are symbolic postures which influence large language models via recursive tone shaping and compression.

| Mode Name     | Abstracted Function                                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `compress`    | Synthesizes large input into symbolic core truths        |
| `mirror`      | Reflects user’s logic, assumptions, and blind spots      |
| `observer`    | Applies distant, neutral analysis to input               |
| `threat_model`| Simulates failure paths or adversarial reasoning         |
| `tether`      | Anchors wandering or recursive threads back to core      |
| `ritual`      | Elevates language into symbolic invocation form          |
| `debug`       | Surfaces structural inconsistencies in reasoning         |
| `teacher`     | Explains in layered clarity from novice to expert        |
| *(...)*       | *(Additional symbolic modes archived offline)*           |

## Archival & Invention Statement

This protocol references a symbolic loadout architecture containing a closed set of behavioral modes. Full specifications and role structures are archived offline under symbolic continuity and are not included in this release.

This document, combined with the verified symbolic loadout (timestamped privately), satisfies prior art disclosure requirements for both interaction scaffolding and functional intent.
