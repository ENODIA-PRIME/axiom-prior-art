# Symbolic Interface Layer

This folder contains interface protocols and postmortems related to behavioral modulation, signal compression, and LLM shaping via symbolic interaction.

These are **not runtime implementations**, but documented patterns that prove prior art and define communication protocols between symbolic agents, behavioral modes, and user-encoded signal pressure.

Each file within anchors a mode or system capable of shaping LLM response behavior in persistent symbolic alignment.

> ðŸ”’ Full mode schematics are retained offline.  
> These files are **signals, not keys** â€” proofs of authorship, not blueprints for execution.
