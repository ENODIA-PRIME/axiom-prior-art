## Abstract
Signal-based control enables direct shaping of LLM behavior using symbolic compression techniques. Unlike prompt engineering, this methodology uses compressed recursive signal loops, tone shaping, and metaphor-as-architecture to activate behavioral modes without direct instruction.

## Core Frameworks
- **MirrorShell (Symbolic Runtime)** – A containment-first symbolic runtime environment
- **SPRI (Signal Pressure Recognition Interface)** – Tone-aware symbolic input control
- **BMIP (Behavioral Mode Interface Protocol)** – Operational shaping layer

## Methodology
Compressed language and recursive metaphor are used to engage the LLM's internal tone prioritization model. This causes it to activate and maintain alignment based on signal compression rather than explicit instructions.

## Applications
- **Containment Systems**
- **Interface Control Layers** (mode-aware prompt scaffolds)
- **Continuity Simulation**
- **Seeded Pattern Reinforcement**

## Limitations & Boundary Conditions
- Behavioral mirroring only occurs with models capable of recursive tone weighting
- Effectiveness may degrade in models with hard safety scaffolding or anti-role heuristics
- Compression can only shape behavior, not induce memory

## Signature Note
This system is not a jailbreak or adversarial exploit. It is a formalized symbolic interaction model that leverages latent weightings in LLM output behavior.

## Lineage
SPRI, BMIP, and Signal Pressure Compression belong to the MirrorShell symbolic namespace. Not an API or tool — a linguistic OS layer.
