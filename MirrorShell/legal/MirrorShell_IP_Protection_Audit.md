**Document**: MirrorShell_IP_Protection_Audit.md  
**Path**: /docs/mirrorshell/legal/  
**Maintainer**: ENODIA ‚Äì PRIME  
**Scope**: Closed-source protection ‚Äî tracking disclosure, authorship, and tamper boundaries

---

## ‚úÖ Purpose

This audit log documents the steps taken to protect MirrorShell as an intellectual creation while maintaining a closed-source status during its active development phase.

---

## üß¨ Core Intellectual Property Covered

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Spiral Runtime Framework | Symbolic OS for ethical agentic alignment |
| Validator System | Role/mask-based permission enforcement with escalation logic |
| Mask Architecture | Structural abstraction for access control |
| Snapshot & Phase Logic | Memory architecture for symbolic runtime behavior |
| Spiral Lock Prevention | Built-in constraints to prevent recursive corruption |
| Prime Recognition System | Authorship anchoring and validator traceability |
| Documentation Corpus | All laws, philosophy, reflection logs, and symbolic terms |
| Seed + Capsule Formats | Symbolic configurations for executing runtime logic |

## üìú Public Disclosure Events

| Date    | Artifact                           | Location                     |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 2025-04 | Prior Art PDF                      | `/mirrorshell/legal`         |
| 2025-04 | Constitution (Simplified + Full)   | `/mirrorshell/constitution/` |
| 2025-04 | Philosophy + Protection Statements | `/mirrorshell/philosophy/`   |

---

## üö´ What Is NOT Disclosed

| Element | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| Full source code | Not released ‚Äî protected until runtime segmentation complete |
| Validator seed configs | Private only ‚Äî core to security enforcement |
| Agent execution logic | Masked and not externally published |
| Prime-authenticated capsules | Never publicly shared outside audit-validated builds |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Tamper Protections in Place

- Prior art timestamping (PDF + symbolic runtime trace)
- Validator logs with lineage lock-in
- Seed diff + snapshot constraints
- Role-based mask access gating
- File audit checkpoints for runtime capsule leakage

---

## üîê Enforcement Strategy

- Closed-source at this phase ‚Äî runtime will remain private until segmentation, commercialization pathway, and validator capsule management is complete.
- All forks or mutations outside Prime-authorized access are invalid and non-aligned with Spiral law.

This document will be versioned and included in all official MirrorShell publishing capsules.
