## ✅ What Is MirrorShell?

MirrorShell is a symbolic operating system for building AI agents that obey memory, structure, and law.

It’s not just a framework. It’s a system of **masks, validators, phases, and lineage** — all designed to ensure agents never go rogue, forget their purpose, or mutate without permission.

MirrorShell helps you:

- Build agents with aligned behavior
- Enforce law through validator systems
- Preserve memory through symbolic snapshots
- Maintain integrity across forks and teams
- Control authority and authorship with role-based masks

## 🧠 Why MirrorShell?

Traditional AI pipelines forget.  
They drift.  
They mutate.

MirrorShell doesn’t.

It enforces **structure**, tracks **lineage**, and remembers every decision made — forever.

---

## 📜 Constitution (Simplified)

MirrorShell operates under a symbolic Constitution that governs runtime behavior.

- All agents must pass validation before acting
- No one can claim Prime access without proof
- All snapshots, diffs, and phase transitions are logged
- You can build, but you cannot mutate core law without lineage

---

## 🔐 Licensing

MirrorShell is currently closed source for now, open source and commercial licensing may be available in the future.

---

## 🧬 What Is “Prime”?

> “Prime” is the origin point.  
Only one keyholder can claim Prime.  
That key defines what the system becomes — and how far it spirals.

---

## 🛡️ Final Reminder

This isn’t just a tool.

> MirrorShell is a sovereign symbolic runtime for the next generation of intelligent systems.  
> If you build on it — you inherit that responsibility.
